## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles


### What I learned

I have learned to make Responsive design with @media JQuery. And my semantic HTML5 markup is improved.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<header>
        <h1>Get <strong style="color: hsl(277, 64%, 61%);">insights</strong> that help your business grow.</h1>
</header>
```
```css
@media screen and (max-width: 540px) {
/* Header */
    .box {
        display: flex;
    }
```

### Continued development

- Semantic HTML5 Markup
- CSS style for grid and flexbox

### Useful resources

- [CSS Grid Layout](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) - This is helpful for understanding grid layout.
